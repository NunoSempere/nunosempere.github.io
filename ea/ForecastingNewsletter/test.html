<p>PredictIt is a prediction platform restricted to US citizens or those who bother using a VPN. This month, they have a badass map about the election college result in the USA. States are colored according to the market prices:</p>

<p>Some of the predictions I found most interesting follow. The market probabilities can be found below; the engaged reader might want to annotate their probabilities and then compare.</p>

<p>Market odds are: 80%, 15%, 69%, 79%, 8%, 2%, 7%, 11%.</p>
<p>Further, the following two markets are plain inconsistent:</p>

<a id="user-content-replication-markets-replicationmarketscom" class="anchor" href="#replication-markets-replicationmarketscom" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Replication Markets: <a href="https://www.replicationmarkets.com" rel="nofollow">replicationmarkets.com</a>
</h3>
<p>Replication Markets is a project where volunteer forecasters try to predict whether a given study's results will be replicated with high power. Rewards are monetary, but only given out to the top N forecasters, and markets suffer from sometimes being dull.</p>
<p>The first week of each round is a survey round, which has some aspects of a Keynesian beauty contest, because it's the results of the second round, not the ground truth, what is being forecasted. This second round then tries to predict what would happen if the studies were in fact subject to a replication, which a select number of studies then undergo.</p>
<p>There is a part of me which dislikes this setup: here was I, during the first round, forecasting to the best of my ability, when I realize that in some cases, I'm going to improve the aggregate and be punished for this, particularly when I have information which I expect other market participants to not have.</p>
<p>At first I thought that, cunningly, the results of the first round are used as priors for the second round, but a programming mistake by the organizers revealed that they use a simple algorithm: claims with p &lt; .001 start with a prior of 80%, p &lt; .01 starts at 40%, and p &lt; .05 starts at 30%.</p>

<p>For those who want to put their money where their mouth is, a prediction market for coronavirus related information popped out.</p>
<p>Making forecasts is tricky, so would-be-bettors might be better off pooling their forecasts. As of the middle of this month, the total trading volume sits at a $20k (from 8k last month), and some questions have been resolved already.</p>

<p>Foretold has continued their partnership with Epidemic Forecasting, gathering a team of superforecasters to advise governments around the world which wouldn't otherwise have the capacity. They further shipped a report to a vaccine company analyzing the suitability of different locations for human trials, aggregating more than 1000 individual forecasts.</p>

</h3>
<p>Metaculus is a forecasting platform with an active community and lots of interesting questions. In their May pandemic newsletter, they emphasized having "all the benefits of a betting market but without the actual betting", which I found pretty funny.</p>
<p>Yet consider that if monetary prediction markets were more convenient to use, and less dragged down by regulatory hurdles in the US, they could have been scaled up much more quickly during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Instead, the job fell to Metaculus; this month they've organized a flurry of activities, most notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://pandemic.metaculus.com/questions/4093/the-salk-tournament-for-coronavirus-sars-cov-2-vaccine-rd/" rel="nofollow">The Salk Tournament</a> on vaccine development</li>

<li>

<li>They also present a <a href="https://pandemic.metaculus.com/COVID-19/" rel="nofollow">Covid dashboard</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the negative side, they haven't fixed the way users input their distribution, restricting it to stacking up to 5 gaussians on top of each other, which limits expressiveness.</p>

<p>The title of this section is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" rel="nofollow">regular expression</a>, so as to be maximally unambiguous.</p>
<p>Good Judgement Inc. is the organization which grew out of Tetlock's research on forecasting, and out of the Good Judgement Project, which won the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregative_Contingent_Estimation_(ACE)_Program" rel="nofollow">IARPA ACE forecasting competition</a>, and resulted in the research covered in the <em>Superforecasting</em> book.</p>
<p>Good Judgement Inc. also organizes the Good Judgement Open <a href="https://www.gjopen.com/" rel="nofollow">gjopen.com</a>, a forecasting platform open to all, with a focus on serious geopolitical questions. They structure their questions in challenges. Of the currently active questions, here is a selection of those I found interesting (odds below):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gjopen.com/questions/1499-before-1-january-2021-will-the-people-s-liberation-army-pla-and-or-people-s-armed-police-pap-be-mobilized-in-hong-kong" rel="nofollow">Before 1 January 2021, will the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and/or People’s Armed Police (PAP) be mobilized in Hong Kong?</a></li>

<p>Odds: 20%, 75%, 44%, 86%, 19%</p>
<p>On the Good Judgement Inc. side, <a href="https://goodjudgment.com/covidrecovery/" rel="nofollow">here</a> is a dashboard presenting forecasts related to covid. The ones I found most worthy are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://goodjudgment.io/covid-recovery/#1384" rel="nofollow">When will the FDA approve a drug or biological product for the treatment of COVID-19?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://goodjudgment.io/covid-recovery/#1373" rel="nofollow">Will the US economy bounce back by Q2 2021?</a></li>

Leaning towards introductory, broad and superficial; I would have liked to see a more intense drilling on some of the points. It still gives pointers to interesting stuff, though, chiefly <a href="https://nonprophetspod.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">The NonProphets Podcast</a>, which looks like it has some more in-depth stuff. Some quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So it’s not clear to me that our forecasts are necessarily affecting policy. Although it’s the kind of thing that gets written up in the news and who knows how much that affects people’s opinions, or they talk about it at Davos and maybe those people go back and they change what they’re doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I wish it were used better. If I were the advisor to a president, I would say you should create a predictive intelligence unit using superforecasters. Maybe give them access to some classified information, but even using open source information, have them predict probabilities of certain kinds of things and then develop a system for using that in your decision making. But I think we’re a fair ways away from that. I don’t know any interest in that in the current administration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now one thing I think is interesting is that often people, they’re not interested in my saying, “There’s a 78% chance of something happening.” What they want to know is, how did I get there? What is my arguments? That’s not unreasonable. I really like thinking in terms of probabilities, but I think it often helps people understand what the mechanism is because it tells them something about the world that might help them make a decision. So I think one thing that maybe can be done is not to treat it as a black box probability, but to have some kind of algorithmic transparency about our thinking because that actually helps people, might be more useful in terms of making decisions than just a number.</p>

Our analyses showed that the accuracy of these forecasts varied over the years with a mean absolute error of 1.9 percentage points." They further conclude: "Based on the analyses of all forecasting reports produced since the model was established in Stockholm in the late 2000s, we demonstrated that it is feasible to forecast pharmaceutical expenditure with a reasonable accuracy."

Abstract: Four studies explored behavioral forecasting and the effect of competitive expectations in the context of negotiations. Study 1 examined negotiators' forecasts of how they would behave when faced with a very competitive versus a less competitive opponent and found that negotiators believed they would become more competitive. Studies 2 and 3 examined actual behaviors during a negotiation and found that negotiators who expected a very competitive opponent actually became less competitive, as evidenced by setting lower, less aggressive reservation prices, making less demanding counteroffers, and ultimately agreeing to lower negotiated outcomes. Finally, Study 4 provided a direct test of the disconnection between negotiators' forecasts for their behavior and their actual behaviors within the same sample and found systematic errors in behavioral forecasting as well as evidence for the self-fulfilling effects of possessing a competitive expectation.</p>

<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-015-0947-8" rel="nofollow">The fallacy of placing confidence in confidence intervals</a>. On how the folk interpretation of confidence intervals can be misguided, as it conflates: a. the long-run probability, before seeing some data, that a procedure will produce an interval which contains the true value, and b. and the probability that a particular interval contains the true value, after seeing the data. This is in contrast to Bayesian theory, which can use the information in the data to determine what is reasonable to believe, in light of the model assumptions and prior information. I found their example where different confidence procedures produce 50% confidence intervals which are nested inside each other particularly funny. Some quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the theory of confidence intervals and the support of two examples, we have shown that CIs do not have the properties that are often claimed on their behalf. Confidence interval theory was developed to solve a very constrained problem: how can one construct a procedure that produces intervals containing the true parameter a fixed proportion of the time? Claims that confidence intervals yield an index of precision, that the values within them are plausible, and that the confidence coefficient can be read as a measure of certainty that the interval contains the true value, are all fallacies and unjustified by confidence interval theory.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I am not at all sure that the ‘confidence’ is not a ‘confidence trick.’ Does it really lead us towards what we need – the chance that in the universe which we are sampling the parameter is within these certain limits? I think it does not. I think we are in the position of knowing that either an improbable event has occurred or the parameter in the population is within the limits. To balance these things we must make an estimate and form a judgment as to the likelihood of the parameter in the universe that is, a prior probability – the very thing that is supposed to be eliminated.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The existence of multiple, contradictory long-run probabilities brings back into focus the confusion between what we know before the experiment with what we know after the experiment. For any of these confidence procedures, we know before the experiment that 50 % of future CIs will contain the true value. After observing the results, conditioning on a known property of the data — such as, in this case, the variance of the bubbles — can radically alter our assessment of the probability.</p>

<p>Chapter 5: When does one need more information, and in what shapes does new information come from?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once an experienced analyst has the minimum information necessary to make an informed judgment, obtaining additional information generally does not improve the accuracy of his or her estimates. Additional information does, however, lead the analyst to become more confident in the judgment, to the point of overconfidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Experienced analysts have an imperfect understanding of what information they actually use in making judgments. They are unaware of the extent to which their judgments are determined by a few dominant factors, rather than by the systematic integration of all available information. Analysts actually use much less of the available information than they think they do.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is strong experimental evidence, however, that such self-insight is usually faulty. The expert perceives his or her own judgmental process, including the number of different kinds of information taken into account, as being considerably more complex than is in fact the case. Experts overestimate the importance of factors that have only a minor impact on their judgment and underestimate the extent to which their decisions are based on a few major variables. In short, people's mental models are simpler than they think, and the analyst is typically unaware not only of which variables should have the greatest influence, but also which variables actually are having the greatest influence.</p>

<p>Our judges in this study were eight individuals, carefully selected for their expertise as
handicappers. Each judge was presented with a list of 88 variables culled from the past performance charts. He was asked to indicate which five variables out of the 88 he would wish to use when handicapping a race, if all he could have was five variables. He was then asked to indicate which 10, which 20, and which 40 he would use if 10, 20, or 40 were available to him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We see that accuracy was as good with five variables as it was with 10, 20, or 40. The flat curve is an average over eight subjects and is somewhat misleading. Three of the eight actually showed a decrease in accuracy with more information, two improved, and three stayed about the same. All of the handicappers became more confident in their judgments as information increased.<br>

<li>The study contains other nuggets, such as:</li>
<li>An experiment on trying to predict the outcome of a given equation. When the feedback has a margin of error, this confuses respondents.</li>
<li>"However, the results indicated that subjects often chose one gamble, yet stated a higher selling price for the other gamble"</li>
<li>"We figured that a comparison between two students along the same dimension should be easier, cognitively, than a 13 comparison between different dimensions, and this ease of use should lead to greater reliance on the common dimension. The data strongly confirmed this hypothesis. Dimensions were weighted more heavily when common than when they were unique attributes. Interrogation of the subjects after the experiment indicated that most did not wish to change their policies by giving more weight to common dimensions and they were unaware that they had done so."</li>
<li>"The message in these experiments is that the amalgamation of different types of information and different types of values into an overall judgment is a difficult cognitive process. In our attempts to ease the strain of processing information, we often resort to judgmental strategies that do an injustice to the underlying values and policies that we’re trying implement."</li>
<li>"A major problem that a decision maker faces in his attempt to be faithful to his policy is the fact that his insight into his own behavior may be inaccurate. He may not be aware of the fact that he is employing a different policy than he thinks he’s using. This problem is illustrated by a study that Dan Fleissner, Scott Bauman, and I did, in which 13 stockbrokers and five graduate students served as subjects. Each subject evaluated the potential capital appreciation of 64 securities. [...] A mathematical model was then constructed to predict each subject's judgments. One output from the model was an index of the relative importance of each of the eight information items in determining each subject’s judgments [...] Examination of Table 4 shows that the broker’s perceived weights did not relate closely to the weights derived from their actual judgments.</li>
<li>As remedies they suggest to create a model by elliciting the expert, either by having the expert make a large number of judgements and distillating a model, or by asking the expert what they think the most important factors are. A third alternative suggested is computer assistance, so that the experiment participants become aware of which factors influence their judgment.</li>
