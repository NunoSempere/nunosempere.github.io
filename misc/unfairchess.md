# Unfair chess

Rules: 
- Rule 1: Player One controls the white pieces. For every move he makes, Player Two makes two moves
- Rule 2: unless the white king is threatened, in which case Player One can react immediately.
- Rule 3a: Player One wins if they're not checkmated for X moves. X begins at 30 and is adjusted (downwards) as more games are played, according to the best judgement of the players. Once both players get used to the game, I recommend 15 moves.
- (Rule 3b: Win conditions are as normal: Player One wins if they checkmate Player 2, and viceversa).
- (Rule 4: Neither player has a queen).

Benefits of this variant:
- I've found that the game is both stimulating for myself, a player who is relatively good at chess, and for players who are much worse; who are sharp, know and enjoy the game but haven't sunk much time into it. I play as Player One, 
- I also enjoy playing with Rule 3b instead of 3a, because I don't feel bothered by losing. Defeat is unavoidable.
